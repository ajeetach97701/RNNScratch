# RNN Scratch Implementation (Feed Forward Only)

This repository contains a scratch implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) focusing on the feed forward pass.

## Structure

- **Data/clean_weather.csv**: Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
- **src/FeedForward.py**: Core implementation of the RNN feed forward logic.
- **test.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to run and test the feed forward implementation.

## Usage

1. Data file is located in the `Data/` directory.
2. Open and run `test.ipynb` to execute the feed forward process using the implementation in `src/FeedForward.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11(the version in which this file was build.)
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Any dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Notes

- This implementation covers only the feed forward pass of an RNN.
- For educational purposes and understanding RNN internals.
